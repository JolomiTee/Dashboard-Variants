# Dashboard-Variants

A repository containing designs of 3 various dashboard mockup designs namely Blok, Damostik and HotelsNg.

## What I plan to achieve building this project.

This project will enable me to apply my current knowledge in building a Functional react app with features like:
* State Management
* Routing
* Data fetching
* Responsiveness
* And the use of Charts, Tables, Graphs from a library called Syncfusion.

### Dependencies used

* React
* React Router Dom
* TailwindCSS
* PostCSS
* Syncfusion Library
* React Icons

## To run this project locally
* You can fork the repo to your Github account and then open it from your local machines's command line, or you can clone to your local device by copying the project URL you find when you click on the big blue ```<> Code``` button above. Alternatively you can download as a ZIP file and extract on your local machine.
* Open the Folder with your Code editor and start a Terminal at the root of the folder.
* In your terminal type in the command ```npm i``` or ```npm install```. This step installs all dependencies needed to run the project locally.
* After the dependencies have been installed locally, type in the command ```npm run dev```. This command starts a local server on your machine and also gives you an open port number such as ```http://127.0.0.1:5173/``` which you can open with your favourite browser.
* Thats it, the Dashboard Variant Project is up and running.
